/**
 *
 * Demonstrates the Bridge Pattern.  Bridge allows the abstraction to be decoupled from its implementation.
 * Although at first look this approach appears logical and nothing wrong in it, abstractions through inheritance
 * isnâ€™t always flexible.  Using inheritance permanently binds the implementation to the abstraction.  As a result,
 * any change made to one affects the other.
 *
 * Implementing the composition over inheritance to facilitate the bridge pattern will likely make the implementation
 * more complicated.  However, the flexibility it provides overshadows the complexity.
 *
 * Use the Bridge Pattern with the following situation (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/319728/
 * when-do-you-use-the-bridge-pattern-how-is-it-different-from-adapter-pattern/9406293#9406293):
 *
 *         A
 *       /   \
 *      /     \
 *     Aa      Ab
 *    / \     /  \
 *  Aa1 Aa2  Ab1 Ab2
 *
 *  to provide this:
 *
 *      A          N
 *    /   \       / \
 *   /     \     /   \
 * Aa(N) Ab(N)  1     2
 *
 * In this example, the Mower abstraction can be modified independently of the implementation (Engine).
 *
 * "PREFER COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE" is the basis of this pattern.
 *
 * Related Patterns (Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software):
 *
 *  - An Abstract Factory can create and configure a particular Bridge.
 *  - The Adapter pattern is geared toward making unrelated classes work together.  It is usually applied
 *      to systems after they're designed.  Bridge is used up-front in a design to let abstractions and
 *      implementations vary independently.
